        <h1>Engineer</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Frontend Engineering</h3>
            <div class="details">JavaScript is my current focus. I started serious frontend development in January 2012 at Genologics. At Jimu Labs I <a href="http://arasbm.com/portfolio/web/jimu-web-application/">designed and implemented</a> the client side of an Android app builder. Currently at 14 Oranges I build HTML5 mobile apps dressed in apache cordova.</div>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Backend and Desktop</h3>
            <div class="details">I have created several desktop applications in C++, Java and Python in the past. One of the most challenging and fun apps I created is <a href="http://arasbm.com/gibbon/">Gibbon</a> which I used as part of my master thesis. I have also written small bits of server side code in PHP and Java.</div>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Linux</h3>
            <div class="details">I maintained my own dedicated Linux server for several years and currently run my <a href="http://arasbm.com">personal blog</a> as well as a few other personal projects using a virtual server. I have also been using Linux exclusively for desktop, home entertainment, and of course development environment for the last 8 years.</div>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Git</h3>
            <div class="details">I use git on daily basis and prefer the command line interface. Most of the git projects I contribute to are <a href="https://github.com/arasbm">on github</a>. I have used subversion and a few other version controls enough to know I should try to avoid them.</div>

        <h1>Designer</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Interaction Design</h3>
            <div class="details">While I was a student at the <a href="http://visid.cs.uvic.ca/">visual interaction design lab</a>, I took several courses on this topic and have learnt to appreciate principals of good interaction design. At Jimu lab I had a <a href="http://arasbm.com/portfolio/web/jimu-web-application/">unique opportunity</a> to put my interaction design knowledge into practice.</div>
          </li>
          <li><h3>User Experience</h3>
            <div class="details">I have conducted and participated in several user studies involving data collection techniques such as video and audio recording, questionnaires and field notes. Regardless of my role in a software project, I have always been active in trying to grasp a good understanding of the user experience our product had to offer.</div>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Prototyping</h3>
            <div class="details">During my graduate studies I have often used paper and video prototyping tools to communicate my design ideas by creating low fidelity prototypes. I am also comfortable using Inkscape and gimp for prototyping</div>
          </li>
          <li><h3>Information Visualization</h3>
            <div class="details">Information Visualization is another topic that I explored during my school years. I have created small interactive visualization using D3.js, jsPlumb and a few other libraries. I also created static visualizations of data using the R environment and tools on Linux.</div>
